# Prosperetti
contains a matlab script (Numerical_inverseLT_Prosperetti.m) that numerically inverts the dimensionless amplitude in Laplace space for the interface between two superimposed fluids
and a matlab script (Compare_amplitudes.m) that compares the amplitude from the numerical inverse LT to the amplitude data from a Basilisk simulation. 
In order to run Numerical_inverseLT_Prosperetti.m, you need to download the Numerical Inverse Laplace Transform package from Tucker McClure (2013). 

I've included some data from my Basilisk simulation, labelled "amplitude_Ga(...).dat", and the corresponding figures where this data is compared to the numerically inverted LT data, labelled "Ga(...).png".
